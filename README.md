# SPM ONE — Industrial Asset Management Prototype

A Next.js 16 + React 19 prototype for industrial asset performance management.

---

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your Mac before starting.

### 1. Node.js (v20 or later)

Check if you already have it:
```bash
node -v
```

If not installed, download from https://nodejs.org (choose the **LTS** version), or use a version manager:
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install node

# Or using nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### 2. pnpm (package manager used by this project)

Check if you already have it:
```bash
pnpm -v
```

If not installed:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Download and unzip

Download the ZIP from v0, then unzip it. You will get a folder. Open Terminal and navigate into it:
```bash
cd path/to/spm-one
```

### Step 2 — Delete the v0 internal env file

The ZIP may include a file named `.env.development.local` that contains v0-specific credentials. Delete it — it is not needed locally and should not be kept:
```bash
rm .env.development.local
```

### Step 3 — Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This downloads all packages listed in `package.json` into a local `node_modules` folder. It may take 1–2 minutes on the first run.

### Step 4 — Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

The server supports Hot Module Replacement — any file you save will instantly update in the browser without a full reload.

## Adding Your Custom Images

Two image slots are ready and waiting. Place your files at exactly these paths inside the project folder:

| Image | Path | Used on |
|---|---|---|
| Site aerial map | `public/images/site-map.jpg` | Site X Overview Dashboard (map background) |
| P&ID process diagram | `public/images/pid-diagram.jpg` | Plant Overview (right panel diagram) |

The app will automatically pick them up — no code changes needed. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`.

## Deploying to Vercel

### Option A — Deploy directly from v0 (easiest)

Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of the v0 interface. Vercel handles everything automatically.

### Option B — Deploy from GitHub

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new and import the repository.
3. Leave all build settings at their defaults — Vercel auto-detects Next.js.
4. Click **Deploy**. No environment variables are required.

**Custom images on Vercel:**
If you want `site-map.jpg` and `pid-diagram.jpg` to appear on the deployed site, commit them into `public/images/` in your repository before deploying. Files in `public/` are served as static assets.

## Notes

- **No database, no backend, no API keys required.** All data is static mock data in `lib/data.ts`.
- **No `.env` file needed.** Delete `.env.development.local` from the ZIP (it is a v0-internal file, not needed locally or on Vercel).
- The `node_modules` folder is not included in the ZIP — `pnpm install` creates it fresh.
- The `.next` build cache folder is also not included — it is created automatically on first `pnpm dev` run.
- If port 3000 is already in use on your machine, Next.js will automatically try 3001, 3002, etc. and print the actual URL in the terminal.
